## About bestbuybot
I built bestbuybot to purchase an often scalped GPU for personal use. **Please do not use this software for scalping purposes.** This software was built for Windows use with Google Chrome thru Selenium and ChromeDriver. This should be easily adaptable to any other operating system. If you do this, feel free to submit a pull request and I will happily merge.

### bestbuybot's Functionality
At it's current stage, this software can:  
- Enter a product purchasing queue (thru bot_queue.py)
- Add a product to cart
- Advance from cart to checkout
- Log in to Best Buy account
- Fill in CVV for card linked with account
- Click order button
- Send text messages through Twilio (easily removable)
